## Technical Achievements

- **Tech Achievement 1**: I was able to create the applicaiton that allows user to submit entries of data and the display to show the updated data, including the derived field. Even with page refreshes, the data stays visable in the table.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements

I had two users review my design with think-aloud protocols. Both users were asked to add and remove a book from the application.

- **Design Achievement 1**:

1. Viera
2. The user was confused with the rating system and what it was out of. They also noticed there was no requirements with the start and the end date.
3. I was suprised to hear that the user noticed the start and end dates allowing for dates after the current date as I did not consider adding that requirement previous.
4. I would add information to specifiy the what the rating are out of with either limitations on the inputs or a description.

- **Design Achievement 2**:

1. McCormick
2. The user noticed there was issues with date validation and that a user can input a date past the current date and also put the start date after the end date. They also noticed that if two books with the same data were added, when one is deleted they both will be removed.
3. I was suprised to hear that the user noticed the deletion of books issue as this was a planned aspect. I intended for two books with the same data to be removed together, however, I see how other could view this as a problem.
4. I would like to add more date validation in the future to ensure the start date cannot be after the end date.
